A brief explanation
------------------------
- I put two animations examples for Homepage OUR SERVICES section, because in Figma desc it says to do flip animation, and in presentation I saw the animation is zoom-in
- I also put animation on buttons, as the demo
- For homapage empty section, I duplicate a portfolio but hide the content (just show empty space), the empty-space-height is same as one of the content, so user can scroll until the end of the background content
- For me, the website is looks good enough now, since we use very limited time to finish it. But if need a revision, I'm all for it
