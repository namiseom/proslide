A brief explanation (Frontend)
------------------------
<ul>
  <li> I put two animations examples for Homepage OUR SERVICES section, because in Figma desc it says to do flip animation, and in presentation I saw the animation is zoom-in</li>
  <li> I also put animation on buttons, as the demo</li>
  <li> For homapage's empty section, I duplicate a portfolio, and hide the content (so it's just showing empty space), now the empty-space-height is the same as one of the portfolio, so user can scroll down until the end of the parallax</li>
</ul>

A brief explanation (Backend)
<ul>
  <li>For Custom post type's front-end, I make a custom Elementor widget instead of showing it directly using code or shortcode, as shown in wp-content/themes/hello-elementor/widgets/proslide-portfolio.php. this might take a little bit more time, but it will be good for long term use, and more easy to use for user/editor-user</li>
  <li>Custom Plugin Name: Custom Contact Form</li>
</ul>
<li> I'm all for it if we need a revision</li>

HAVE A GREAT DAY EVERYONE~
